// Questions
// 1: This is referring to the character (or object) whose methods are being
// called. Similar to 'self' in Ruby
// 2: The parens are where arguments for a function or method are placed.
// 3: The semicolons are used at the end of statements. Similar to a period or
// a newline.

// Reflection:
// I didn't run into any major issues during this challenge. Often, my
// pseudocode didn't quite line up with what the game wanted (e.g. not enough
// moves in a direction), but that was easily fixed.
// I didn't have any burning questions or difficult concepts. I found these
// first missions to be very simple.
// I didn't really enjoy the challenge. At the beginning, it was quite obvious
// how to complete each one. The difficiult part was working around the
// interface, which seemed to randomly refresh and call spells which weren't
// ready. I spent more time trying to trick the game into running properly 
// than writing code or coming up with solutions. I would hope that the game
// gets more responsive and challenging syntactically as you progress.
