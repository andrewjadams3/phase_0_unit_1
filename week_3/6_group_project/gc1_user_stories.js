// As a user, I want to find the sum, the mean, and the median of a list of
// numbers. These should be three separate functions.

// The first function, sum, should add up every number in a list and provide the
// total. For example, for a list containing the numbers 3, 4, and 5, the sum
// function should provide the answer 12.

// The second function, mean, should provide the mean (the average) of a list of
// numbers. Again, for a list containing the numbers 3, 4, and 5, the mean
// function should provide the answer 4.

// Finally, the median function should find the median (the middle number) of a 
// list of numbers. For a list containing the numbers 3, 4, and 5, the median
// function should provide the answer 4. However, for a list containing the
// numbers 2, 3, 4, and 5, the median function should provide the answer 3.5.

// You can assume that lists of numbers will be already be sorted from smallest
// to largest.

// Each function should should work properly when given a list with an even
// number of items, as well as a list with an odd number of items.
