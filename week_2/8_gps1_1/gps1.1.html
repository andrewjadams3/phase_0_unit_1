			 		<h3>Why Pair Programming is Important</h3>
			 		<p>Right now, pair programming is a fantastic way for students at DBC to get to know one another. Creating relationships with the people you work with is extremely important. We will be spending a great deal of time with each other very shortly, and if we haven't gotten to know each other or feel comfortable opening up, it will be difficult to learn and grow as a group.</p>
			 		<p>Most of the challenges require a tremendous amount of individual work. However, each person will approach these challenges differently, and gain a unique understanding of the material. By pairing with another person, you not only have a chance to share and reinforce what you have learned, but you also gain a different perspective. Your pair may have picked up on something you hadn't, or has an area of expertise that they can share with you. By collaborating and sharing strengths, each person becomes better.</p>
			 		<p>Finally, pair programming allows you an opportunity to learn to negotiate with someone else. You each may have different ideas and approaches, and it's important to be able to hear out your pair and combine ideas. This will transfer to a web development career where almost everything is created in a team environment.</p>

			 		<h3>Driver vs. Navigator</h3>
			 		<p>The driver should take directions from the navigator while remaining available to double check what the navigator is doing. Their main responsibility is write the code, and not deviate from the agreed-upon path.</p>
			 		<p>The navigator's job is just the opposite. They should be telling the driver what to write, which lines to pay attention to, and what the plan is.</p>
			 		<p>While these roles are necessary, I personally believe that putting the relationship on pause to collaborate is equally as important. If one person has a question, they should feel free to be able to stop and discuss. As long as the roles remain the same, this collaboration can greatly improve the productivity of the pair.</p>

			 		<h3>Pair Reflection</h3>
			 		<p>This first GPS went very well! Gannon and I were able to create a plan and efficiently code a working site, while at the same time exploring meaningful tangents which enhanced our learning. We both we able to contribute equally, and we both were willing to try new ideas. I gained a great amount of insight regarding some CSS positioning techniques. Walking through the process with Gannon and hearing how he planned to approach the problem really helped to expand my view.</p>
			 		<p>While we used Stypi, we primarily broke away from the guidelines and used screen sharing to effectively work on both CSS and HTML and view live site previews. The fact that we were both willing to experiment helped the site turn out successfully!</p>
