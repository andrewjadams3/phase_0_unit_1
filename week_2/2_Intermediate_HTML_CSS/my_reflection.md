# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

##Reflection
* Web standards appear to be extremely helpful. When guidelines are established, best-practices can be agreed upon, writing code becomes simpler, and interpreting someone else's code becomes much easier.
* It does make sense. Setting a group of core attributes and branching off from there makes it much easier to navigate your own code.
* It makes a lot of sense to me to use the `<header>` or `<footer>` tags rather than `<div id="header">` or `<div id="footer">`. The biggest benefit for me is the ability to follow the structure of my HTML just by glancing at it. Creating a framework for the site is also much simpler.
* Many elements have default padding and margins which are browser defined. This makes it very difficult to control how a web page will appear in any given browser. A reset.css zeros out many of these browser-defined attributes, which gives you more control over how your website will actually render.
* I used Firefox for a long time before switching to Chrome. I have also used Safari, Opera, and IE. I have noticed that some sites look slightly (or drastically) different in different browsers. I can't say whether that is good or bad, but I know it is generally a headache to deal with as a web developer. Most developers/designers would like their site to render a specific way regardless of which browser is being used.
