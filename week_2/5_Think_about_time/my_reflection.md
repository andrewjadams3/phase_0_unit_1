# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

##Reflection
* My biggest challenge will be finding time to pair each week until my school year is completed at the end of May. I am currently teaching elementary and high school band, and the end of the year is concert season. In addition to working school days, I have obligations to organize events or host concerts almost every night for the next two weeks. I am not concerned about completing the challenges and homework, but finding a reasonable time to pair with someone from my cohort during the week may prove difficult. 
* I will combat this by getting in touch with my accountability group very early in the week to find agreeable pairing times.
* In terms of completing work, I will try focusing on one challenge at a time. At the beginning of each week, I will look at the overview of challenges, decide on an order, and commit to completing at least one challenge a day. That way, I can spread out my learning, avoid cramming material, and continuously make small improvements.
* My overall plan is to solidify my foundation in each objective, rather than trying to spread myself too thin. I feel that working on something DBC related everyday will also keep me focused and prepped for when on-site learning begins. In addition, I will find time each day to read some part of the supplementary reading material list provided during the prep phase. I hope that by doing this, I will get in the habit of thinking like a developer, and at least some of the best practices outlined in the material will sink in.
