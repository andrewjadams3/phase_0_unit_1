# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url:[http://andrewada.ms/dbc_blog](http://andrewada.ms/dbc_blog "DBC Blog")

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

##Reflection
* I learned that thinking about the design and user experience of your site should be one of your very first considerations. If you create a cool looking site, but it isn't usable or navigable, people will not visit your site.
* I thought it was a lot of fun designing my site! I spent a lot of time considering my layout. I found wireframing to be extremely helpful when it came to coding the site. Since I already had a clear plan, I had a much better idea of what I needed to do to achieve a functional site.
* My process involved a lot of trial and error. Although I had my site framed out and a general idea of where my elements should be positioned, quirky layout bugs popped up many times. I generally fixed them by trying different positioning tricks, or by consulting stack overflow. The good thing is I feel much better prepared to diagnose and fix those problems than I did at the beginning of this week.
* I would like to flesh the site out by adding some examples of projects I have worked on. I may also add a sidebar that links to other DBC challenges. I would also like to add a few more images to the site (as it is, the site seems somewhat bare).
* Some of the material (mostly CSS positioning) did not always work out the way I expected. However, many of the responsive elements, like em font sizes and media queries, were much simpler to implement than I anticipated! This was my first time experimenting with media queries, and when my site started to come together, I had several lightbulb moments which allowed me to implement some cool responsive features.
