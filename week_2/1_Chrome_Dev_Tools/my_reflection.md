# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

##Reflection
* The DOM is a structured representation of a web page. Any HTML element is an object within the document, and any nested HTML element is a child of that object. An object can have one parent and multiple children. The DOM allows for the manipulation of objects through events, properties, and methods. Without much experience with Javascript, I am not totally familiar how scripts can manipulate the DOM, but the principle makes sense. Dividing the control of objects between HTML, CSS, and Javascript certainly allows for creativity and freedom, but it seems like the organization could quickly get messy.
* The wordpress site was complicated, and organized into a large number of divs. Things appeared to be very precisely laid out, but it seemed that small changes could easily throw off the layout of the entire site.
* I found the dev tools to be a lot of fun! There were times where I was uncertain how to navigate through the CSS tree or pinpoint where a certain style was originating from, but it gave me a much clearer understanding of how a web page is structured overall.
* This was the first time I really started to understand what the DOM was and how it relates to web development. In a previous web development course I had taken, we used minidom in python as a DOM implementation to parse XML. I didn't fully understand what its purpose was though, and merely accepted it as python's way to interact with another site's API. Reading through the resources and using chrome dev tools really helped solidify my understanding, and I'm looking forward to learning more about Javascript so I can get my hands dirty by manipulating objects.
