## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

##Reflection
* To create a repository, simple visit your GitHub profile, click on the "Repositories" tab, and click the green "New" button. Once there, assign your repository any name you like, and add an optional description. You can also initialize your repository with a default README.md file, as well as a license, by choosing the appropriate options from the drop-down menus.
* To clone the repository onto your own computer, open your terminal, and type "git clone", followed by the clone URL provided on your repository's GitHub page.
* Open source describes software whose code is freely available for anyone to download, analyze, and customize.
* I believe open source is a very good thing. Not only are open source projects transparent, they can be full-featured, customizable, and efficient. Since anyone can contribute to open source projects, they are a great way for anyone looking for more experience or understanding of code to learn from others and gain new skills.
* Using a license allows you to specify how you would like your code to be shared and used. Without a license, basic copyright laws take effect which generally means that others cannot modify or reproduce your code. If you want your project to be open source, adding a license will clearly state your intentions.
* I never realized that by not including an open source license with my GitHub projects, I was effectively disallowing others from doing anything with my code. From now on, I will be sure to include an appropriate open source license with any project I share.
* The [GitHub article on Open Source Licensing](https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing "Open Source Licensing") was very helpful in understanding the importance of including open source licenses in your repositories.
