## Reflection
* The specificity of HTML is very helpful when learning how each tag works. It's nice to be able to visually see the changes you are making to HTML when previewing your page. I partially understand how HTML is parsed, but I still don't quite understand how some browsers handle and display HTML in slightly different ways (e.g. IE vs Chrome).
* HTML seems very descriptive and organized. It is nice that you can completely remove the styling aspects and only focus on what you want to appear on the page. However, since every tag needs to be closed, it seems that mistakes could easily happen and cause huge headaches.
* Reading about the DOM on Mozilla's intro to CSS was very enlightening. I had heard many references to the DOM before, but had never seen it broken down and explained, especially in the context of HTML and CSS. Seeing a visual representation was very helpful, and I feel like I am on my way to understanding its relation to web development, specifically the interactions between HTML, CSS, and JS.
