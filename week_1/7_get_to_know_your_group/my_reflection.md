## 7. [Getting to know your group](7_get_to_know_your_group/readme.md)

Copy the email you sent to your group in this file.

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

##Email
Hi everyone! Thanks for getting us started Spencer. I, too, will update my reflection once all the emails have been sent.

My name is Andrew Adams and I live in Kansas City (on the Kansas side). I graduated from the University of Kansas in 2012 with a degree in music education, and I have been teaching elementary and high school band for past two years. My primary instrument is saxophone, though I play most anything. I'm a big jazz nerd, and if DBC weren't going to be so crazy I would probably bring my horns up to Chicago to gig.

My favorite websites are Udacity, Engadget, and Reddit. You can check out my wireframes here: http://andrewada.ms/dbc_blog/unit1_projects/wireframe_sites.html

My learning style is multimodal (Visual: 9, Aural: 10, Read/Write: 8, Kinesthetic: 11), but like Spencer, I feel like I do learn best by doing. My thinking style is also Abstract Sequential, with Concrete Random just a couple points behind. This indicates that I enjoy theory, abstract thought, and experimentation. I guess that sounds like me!

Coincidentally, I had set up a blog with a custom domain on my GitHub pages page just a week before Phase 0, so I've had to host all my projects in a subfolder. You can find all my week 1 projects here (though I'm still working on my cultural blog post): http:/andrewada.ms/dbc_blog

I'm looking forward to meeting with you guys soon! I'm usually free in the evenings, so if anyone wants to set up a pair session next week, just let me know!
