* **Concepts**
	* I struggled somewhat with the CSS box model. Visually it makes sense, but I'm still not comfortable writing CSS for positioning without frequently checking what the page looks like. Most positioning was achieved through a large amount of experimentation.
	* I used several div wrappers to help organize the CSS in a more logical and DRY way. This involved a lot of trial and error, but ended up working very well. Some resources I found suggested using SASS to organize CSS logically, I hope to look more into this in the future.
* **Skills/Tricks**
	* I learned about \<header>, \<footer>, \<nav>, \<aside>, and several other semantic elements. There seem to be varying opinions about the best practices and uses of these elements, but they all appear to be widely used. I experimented with these tags for this challenge.
	* The border-box trick was very useful, and certainly helped the box model work in a logical way. I encountered many positive posts and strong advocates regarding border-box, but I am still not sure if implementing it is considered best practice. I will continue to investigate further.
* **Competencies**
	* *Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins:* I feel like I understand positioning at a much deeper level, and am capable of styling basic layouts. However, I am very interested in learning more about responsive websites, and how to use CSS to properly adjust layouts for various screen sizes.
	* *Use HTML tags to present information on a website:* I feel very comfortable using, organizing, and nesting a number of HTML tags. I am becoming more aware when to use specific tags. I am still learning the best ways to assign and label CSS selectors.
* **Enjoyed**
	* I enjoyed playing around with floating divs to create the content and sidebar. Once I understood the padding, I was able to experiment with different sizes, shapes and positions.
* **Tedious**
	*	Working with the padding/margins to avoid overlapping divs.
	* Assigning and labeling CSS selectors (organizing CSS).
