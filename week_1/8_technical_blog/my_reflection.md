## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

##Reflection
I found the exercise of comparing three websites to be beneficial and informative. A lot of the design aspects of the sites I chose were things I took for granted (like ease of use and layouts). I was also surprised that when I stepped back to look at engadget.com, it seemed so cluttered! The layout still worked and I felt comfortable navigating the site, but it was visually distracting. I suppose that is just something I've gotten used to.

Writing the blog post itself was a bit tedious. Also, being a bit of a perfectionist, I found myself spending a lot of time creating the blog template. However, I am glad I put in the time. I feel much more confident with css, and I am beginning to understand how elements will appear on a page with different positioning techniques. I still found myself referencing my solo challenge this week to refresh my memory on a few design concepts, but overall I feel like I can put together a site with my own knowledge.
