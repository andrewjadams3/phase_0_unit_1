* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

##Reflection
* I learned that DNS delay can be caused both by how long your domain registrar takes to process your DNS request, as well as how long it takes your personal name server to learn about the change. This means the delay can be as short as a few minutes, or as long as 48 hours. I also learned how name servers function: remembering domain name and IP pairings similar to a phone book.
* It is important to wrap your content within proper tags so a browser can render the site correctly. You must always close your tags once you open them. Leaving open tags can create major formatting errors across your site.
* Since I already use GitHub Pages to host my personal blog, [andrewada.ms](http://andrewada.ms "Andrew Adams"), I have become accustomed to feeling relief when I see that an update has deployed properly. In order to work around my site, I had to set up a new repository, and host the index page for this challenge on a separate gh-page branch. I was very happy to see that the page rendered appropriately at [andrewada.ms/dbc_blog](http://andrewada.ms/dbc_blog "DBC Blog").
* I had never given much thought to how DNS operates, so reading about how a name server can translate a domain name to an IP was very enlightening.
