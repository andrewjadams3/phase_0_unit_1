## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

##Reflection
* I have been using Git and GitHub for a while now, but the initial set up taught me a lot about how to properly use the command line and organize my projects.
* Git is version control software that resides locally on your computer. It allows you to keep track of and organize your modifications to a project. GitHub is a remote server where you can host and share your projects, including all of the changes and versions you have created using Git.
* Version control allows you to track the changes you make to a file or project. GitHub allows multiple people to view and contribute to a project. Every change that someone makes is tracked, and GitHub allows changes to be pulled locally so all code is up to date.
* Developers use version control for many reasons. Version control allows developers to roll-back to earlier versions of code to fix mistakes, work on seperate branches to experiment with changes, and develop code collaboratively. This make a lot of sense because it creates a number of different fail-safes, and allows multiple people to contribute to a project at the same time.
* I have become fairly comfortable with Git and GitHub over the past few months, but I am still somewhat unsure how to resolve conflicts. I have not had an opportunity to write code collaboratively, but I am looking forward to gaining that experience soon!
