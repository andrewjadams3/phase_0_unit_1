## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what? 
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

##Reflection
* One of the biggest takeaways from the wireframing resources for me was that if a user cannot navigate a black & white wireframe site, they will never be able to navigate a polished, developed site with the same concept. Wireframing is crucial to understanding the goals of the site and how a user will interact with it.
* I found mocking up wireframes to be a lot of fun! It allowed me to truly focus on design aspects rather than worrying about how the CSS and formating will come together. I believe starting with a wireframe will actually help me improve my coding skills by forcing me to work within a preconceived design, rather than only building what I already know how to build.
* I am still experimenting with my own design process. There seem to be many opinions and processes that have been developed, but I don't think I will know which works best for me until I have more opportunities to experiment and learn.
* I found that using Google Drawings works very well simple wireframes. Although it is not as robust and precise as other tools, it is perfect for making a quick sketch or basic layout. Also, by using Google Drawings, your sketches and wireframes are already hosted on the cloud, making them very easy to share or collaborate with other people.
* I feel very comfortable with each of the learning competencies. This exercise was a lot of fun.
* I had a great time reverse engineering my favorite sites by creating wireframes! It really helped me understand the design and think about the minute aspects of each site. All of the small links, sidebars, and visual aspects can easily be overlooked, but breaking each one down forces you to think very hard about their purpose.
* Some of the articles described the design process in fairly vague terms, which made applying the concepts specifically to web design somewhat of a leap. It is beneficial, however, to understand that design thinking can and should be applied to any number of creative scenarios.
